# How to Add New Projects

This guide shows you how to easily add new projects to your portfolio using the JSON-based content system.

## Quick Start (2-Step Process)

### Step 1: Create Your Project Entry
Edit `portfolio/src/content/projects/projects.json` and add a new project object to the array:

```json
{
  "id": 6, // Next available ID
  "title": "My Awesome Project",
  "description": "A brief description of what this project does.",
  "status": "active", // Options: "active" | "completed" | "paused"
  "technologies": ["React", "Node.js"], // Array of technology names
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/username/my-awesome-project",
  "demoUrl": "https://my-awesome-project.example.com",
  "category": "Web Development", // Choose from existing categories or add new ones
  "featured": true, // Set to false if not a featured project
  "startDate": "2024-08-15", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD
  "endDate": null, // For ongoing projects, use null. Format: YYYY-MM-DD for completed
  "highlights": [
    "Key feature 1",
    "Important aspect 2",
    "Notable achievement 3"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Development Log (Optional but Recommended)
Create a markdown file in `portfolio/src/content/projects/project-logs/` with your project's development story.

```bash
touch portfolio/src/content/projects/project-logs/my-awesome-project-log.md
```

Write a detailed development log using the format:

```markdown
# My Awesome Project Development Log

## Project Overview
A brief overview of what this project is about and its goals.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Key decisions made during planning
- Architecture design or approach chosen

### Phase 2: Implementation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Challenges faced and how they were overcome
- Important code snippets or technical solutions

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (YYYY-MM-DD)
- How testing was conducted
- Any issues found and fixed

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
- Major challenges faced during development
- How each challenge was addressed with technical details

## Key Learnings
- Important insights gained from this project
- Skills or knowledge acquired

## Future Enhancements
- Ideas for future improvements to the project
```

Add the filename to your project entry:

```json
"projectLog": "my-awesome-project-log.md"
```

**That's it!** Your project will automatically appear on your website.

## Required Fields

When adding a new project, these fields are required:

- `id`: A unique number for each project (increment the last ID used)
