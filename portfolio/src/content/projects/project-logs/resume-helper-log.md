# Resume Helper Development Log

## Project Overview
The Resume Helper is an application designed to analyze and improve resumes by comparing them with job descriptions, providing tailored recommendations for better alignment with job requirements. It combines front-end React components with a back-end API built in Python/Flask.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning (2025-07-01)
- Defined project scope and features
- Chose tech stack: React.js, TypeScript, Flask, Docker
- Designed system architecture including front-end/back-end separation

### Phase 2: Backend Development (2024-07-15 - 2024-07-20)
- Implemented resume parsing functionality with OCR and PDF support
- Developed job description analysis algorithms
- Built recommendation engine using natural language processing
- Set up API endpoints for front-end communication

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (2025-07-01 - 2024-IN PROGRESS)
- Created responsive UI components in React/TypeScript
- Implemented file upload and resume preview functionality
- Added job description input and analysis results display
- Integrated with back-end API for seamless data flow

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Combined front-end and back-end components
- Conducted thorough testing of all features
- Fixed cross-browser compatibility issues
- Optimized performance for large resume files

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
- **Resume Parsing**: Developed robust PDF parsing with OCR fallback for scanned documents
- **API Integration**: Implemented secure communication between front-end and back-end services
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized NLP algorithms for faster processing of large texts

## Key Learnings
- Gained experience building full-stack applications with containerization
- Improved understanding of natural language processing in practical applications
- Enhanced skills in responsive UI design and API development

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more file formats (Word documents, plain text)
- Implement machine learning models for more advanced recommendations
- Add user authentication and account management features
