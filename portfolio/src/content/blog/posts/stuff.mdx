# Project Retrospective: Chat Application

A detailed look at the challenges faced and lessons learned while building a real-time chat application.

In this retrospective, we'll analyze what went well during the development of our chat app, where we faced obstacles, and how these experiences can help shape future projects. We'll cover design decisions, technical challenges, and user feedback.
