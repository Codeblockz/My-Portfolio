# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: Memory Bank Initialization

### What We're Doing Now
- **Status**: Initializing Memory Bank system for portfolio project
- **Current Task**: Creating all 6 core Memory Bank files
- **Phase**: Foundation setup before development begins

### Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` with core project requirements and scope
- Established `productContext.md` with user experience goals and content strategy
- Documented `techContext.md` with complete technology stack and constraints
- Built `systemPatterns.md` with architectural patterns and design decisions
- Currently working on `activeContext.md` (this file)
- Next: Create `progress.md` to complete Memory Bank initialization

### Current Work Focus

#### Memory Bank Structure
Following the hierarchy specified in .clinerules:
```
projectbrief.md (Foundation) → productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
                            ↓
                     activeContext.md (Current state)
                            ↓
                     progress.md (Status tracking)
```

#### Key Information Sources
- **Primary Requirements**: `portfolio_prompt.md` contains comprehensive project specifications
- **Project Rules**: `.clinerules` defines Memory Bank structure and workflows
- **Repository**: GitHub repository already set up at https://github.com/Codeblockz/My-Portfolio.git

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### 1. Complete Memory Bank Setup
- [ ] Finish creating `progress.md` 
- [ ] Verify all 6 core files are complete and interconnected
- [ ] Review Memory Bank for completeness and accuracy

### 2. Project Setup Phase
- [ ] Initialize React project structure
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
- [ ] Create basic component structure
- [ ] Set up development environment

### 3. Core Development Planning
- [ ] Create project file structure based on systemPatterns.md
- [ ] Implement basic React components for each section
- [ ] Set up content management system (MDX/JSON)
- [ ] Begin with Hero section implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Choices Made
- **Framework**: React confirmed as primary choice
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS preferred over CSS modules
- **Content**: MDX for blog posts, JSON/Markdown for projects
- **Email**: Formspree as primary contact form service
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages confirmed

### Design Decisions
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode toggle required
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting with mobile constraints
- **Performance**: Under 2-second load time target
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance required

### Content Strategy Decisions
- **Project Logs**: Detailed development journals for each project
- **Blog Categories**: Technical Tutorials, AI/ML Insights, Project Retrospectives, Industry Thoughts
- **Portfolio Structure**: Featured projects (top 3) + show all functionality
- **Professional Tone**: Authentic but professional voice throughout

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **Component-Based**: Modular React components
- **File Organization**: Feature-based structure with shared components
- **State Management**: React state + Context API for global state
- **Content Loading**: Static imports with dynamic loading capability

### User Experience Patterns
- **Navigation**: Smooth scroll to sections with fixed header
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show key content first, expand on demand
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during async operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

### Content Patterns
- **Project Showcase**: Quality over quantity, detailed development logs
- **Technical Content**: Code highlighting, proper formatting
- **Contact Integration**: Working form with multiple contact methods
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean, scannable layouts

## Learning and Project Insights

### Key Requirements Insights
- **Target Audience**: Technical recruiters need quick evaluation capability
- **Professional Standards**: Clean, modern design avoiding trendy elements
- **Performance Critical**: Fast loading essential for professional impression
